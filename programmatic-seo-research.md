# Deep Research Prompt: Programmatic SEO Done Right

Research programmatic SEO (pSEO) implementation best practices, focusing on what separates successful implementations from those that get penalized or fail to rank.

Cover the following areas in depth:

## 1. What Makes pSEO Work (and Fail)
- Define programmatic SEO and its legitimate use cases
- Document examples of successful pSEO at scale (Zapier integrations, Nomadlist, Wise currency pages, Canva templates)
- Analyze what made these work: data uniqueness, genuine value, user intent match
- Document examples of pSEO that got hit by Google updates (thin content, doorway pages)
- Identify the specific signals Google uses to detect low-quality pSEO

## 2. Google's Perspective
- What do Google's guidelines actually say about programmatically generated content?
- How do Helpful Content Updates, Site Reputation Abuse, and recent spam updates affect pSEO?
- What's the difference between "doorway pages" and legitimate pSEO?
- How does Google's "Scaled Content Abuse" policy apply?

## 3. The Unique Value Problem
- How much unique content per page is actually needed?
- What counts as "unique value" beyond just swapping variables?
- Techniques for adding genuine differentiation at scale
- The role of proprietary data vs. public data
- When to noindex vs. when to let pages compete

## 4. Technical Implementation
- URL structure best practices (subfolders vs. subdomains, flat vs. nested)
- Internal linking architecture for thousands of pages
- Indexation management and crawl budget
- Page speed at scale
- Schema markup for programmatic pages

## 5. Content Strategy
- Template design principles that avoid "sameness"
- Variable vs. conditional content
- Intro/outro uniqueness strategies
- How to handle pages with thin data

## 6. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- City pages with only the city name changed
- Auto-generated content with no editorial value
- Pages targeting zero-search-volume keywords
- Keyword cannibalization between programmatic pages
- Orphan pages not connected to site architecture

## 7. Audit Framework
- How to assess an existing pSEO implementation
- Key metrics: indexation rate, traffic per page, engagement signals
- Red flags that indicate problems
- Recovery strategies if already penalized

## 8. Decision Framework
- When pSEO is the right approach vs. when it's not
- Minimum data requirements
- Authority/trust signals needed before scaling
- Build vs. buy vs. generate decisions

Provide specific examples, case studies, and actionable frameworks throughout. Focus on 2023-2024 best practices given recent Google updates.
