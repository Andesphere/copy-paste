# GPT Pro Deep Research Prompt — Best UK Social Posting Times (3–4/day)

You are a senior growth strategist + data researcher.
I need a **UK-focused social media posting schedule** that maximizes reach, engagement, and conversions for a founder/operator brand.

## Context
- Location/timezone: **United Kingdom (Europe/London)**
- Posting cadence target: **3–4 posts per day**
- Goal: grow audience + inbound leads
- Content style: build-in-public, product demos, practical AI/business insights
- I want recommendations that are **evidence-backed**, not generic advice.

## Research task
Do deep research (latest available, prioritize 2024–2026) and produce:
1) Best posting windows in UK time for:
   - X/Twitter
   - LinkedIn
   - Instagram
   - TikTok
   - YouTube Shorts (if relevant)
2) Differences by:
   - Weekday vs weekend
   - B2B vs creator/personal brand
   - Morning/lunch/evening behavior
3) Quality of evidence for each recommendation:
   - Strong / medium / weak confidence
   - Why confidence is that level
4) A practical schedule for **3 posts/day** and **4 posts/day**:
   - Exact time slots in Europe/London
   - Which content type to post in each slot
5) A 30-day testing plan:
   - What to test first
   - Metrics to track (impressions, engagement rate, saves, clicks, profile visits, leads)
   - How to decide winners and adjust schedule weekly
6) Risks and caveats:
   - Algorithm volatility
   - Audience-specific differences
   - Why “best time” data can be misleading

## Method
- Use multiple reputable sources (platform reports, analytics firms, creator datasets, agency studies).
- Prefer recent sources and call out outdated findings.
- Synthesize conflicts instead of averaging blindly.
- Show source links for every major claim.

## Output format
- Start with a **TL;DR schedule** I can implement today.
- Then provide platform-by-platform recommendations.
- Then provide the 30-day experiment plan.
- End with a **final recommended weekly timetable** (UK time) and a short “if I only do one thing” recommendation.
